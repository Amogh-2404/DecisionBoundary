# Machine Learning Classification Techniques

This repository contains Python implementations of two popular machine learning classification techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Learning with Prototypes (LWP). It includes examples using both Gaussian and Chi-Squared distributions for generating datasets and visualizing decision boundaries.

## Features

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple, yet powerful algorithm for classification based on closest training examples in the feature space.
- **Learning with Prototypes (LWP):** A method that classifies based on the similarity of an example to class prototypes.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes `matplotlib` to visualize the decision boundaries that are created by the KNN and LWP algorithms.
- **Gaussian and Chi-Squared Distributions:** Demonstrates data generation using both Gaussian and Chi-Squared distributions to test the robustness of the classification algorithms.

## Installation

To run these examples, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage 

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can just run the main file. The file has many functions, call the function necessary and it will generate a plot in the 'Plots' folder.

## Demo
Here are some plots generated by the program

## Contributions 
Contributions to improve the implementation or extend the examples are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.

## Note
This template is a starting point. Depending on your project's specifics, such as additional dependencies, more complex setup instructions, or extra features, you might need to add or modify sections.
